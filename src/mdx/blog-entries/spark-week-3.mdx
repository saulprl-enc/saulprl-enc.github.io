# Spark Week 3

<br></br>
Just like the previous week, this one was way less meeting-centered since we've
already gone through many of the onboarding classes. In this case, the
activities assigned to us were both programming and teamwork-focused. Before
talking about the assignments, though, we'll dive into some of the meetings we
had during this week.

<br></br>
## Meetings

<br></br>
### Getting Things Done

<br></br>
_Getting Things Done_ is a workshop that revolves around the GTD methodology,
which is meant to help with time management, and overall keeping the premise
that _Our mind is for having ideas, not holding them._ We dove into this
methodology by breaking it down in steps:

- Collect
- Sort out
- Organize
- Review
- Act

<br></br>
We also learned about some of its pros, such as reducing cognitive overhead and
multitasking, and its cons, like being too flexible and time-consuming at first.

<br></br>
All in all, I think I could start applying this methodology, especially since I
rely a lot on my own memory, increasing cognitive overhead and leading to
procrastination, which leads into the next topic.

<br></br>
### Procrastination

<br></br>
We were given a talk on procrastination. Really needed, in my opinion, since I
believe this is something a lot of people struggle with (especially when working
from home).

<br></br>
Procrastination was defined as the difficulty in starting activities and
committing to them, frequently due to the fear of failure, lack of motivation,
mental health problems, among others. In my case, I've always felt like my main
procrastination _trigger_ is self-regulation issues, since I've always been
impulsive and I constantly find myself overworking on a specific task, driving
me to defer other (and usually more important) activities.

<br></br>
I'm glad that motivation was also one of the covered topics in this talk because
I think it's also something I struggle with from time to time, especially in
those cases where I overwork for an extended period of time and eventually
feeling burnt out.

<br></br>
After this talk, I'm down to try out the Pomodoro technique once again. It's a
technique that seems functional to me but I never got into the habit of using it
consistently.

<br></br>
### Agile class

<br></br>
We had a class about **Agile methodologies**! This was a very informative and
theory-heavy class about agile methodologies and the way they're implemented
across Encora's teams. Even though I've worked on teams using, for instance,
Scrum, it's always nice to have a refresher and it definitely helped me in that
regard. A key takeaway for me was the **atomic check-ins** or **atomic commits**
concept, where the developer commits small fragments of code in order to prevent
major issues or outages.

<br></br>
## Weekly Assignments

<br></br>
Last week, we were given the task of creating a GitHub account. Well, this week
we got to use it! We were assigned a couple of [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)
exercises to solve both as a team and individually.

<br></br>I was in charge of creating the team's GitHub repository where we would
all push our solutions to the exercises we picked. I've done this kind of thing before,
so it wasn't anything new, but it's always good to get some practice.

<br></br>
### Patching Array

<br></br>I picked the [Patching Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/patching-array/)
exercise, which consists of patching an array of numbers until all of its combinations
are capable of adding up to every number from 1 to `n`.

<br></br>
#### The solution

<br />
At first, with `JavaScript`, I really overengineered my solution. I followed the
exercise's context step by step and figured that I needed to perform some array operations
in order to solve it and so I did. I created multiple functions like `getCombinations()`,
`sumCombination()`, and `minPatches()`. When coding the last function, I started
to realize that **I only really needed to figure out which numbers I can't form out
of smaller ones**, but I kept going. Eventually, I tested my solution and it passed
the basic test cases, but when it came to submitting, it simply ran out of time.
My solution was so complex that it would simply take too long to calculate everything.

<br />
Later, I decided to explore my previous idea of just finding out which numbers I
can't form out of smaller numbers, and that's what I did. I modified the `minPatches()`
function to go through the array exactly one time and just check whether I can add
some of the numbers I already have to get new ones (for instance, I can't form `2`
without having multiple `1`s; but once I have `1` and `2`, I can form `3`). This
solution **passed all of the submission test cases**. Afterwards, I coded the same
solution in `Java`.

<br />
### Public blog

<br />
We were given the assignment of creating a public blog where we would document our
journey as **Sparks**. From the moment I read the assignment, I thought _it's most
definitely overkill, but I'll do it in React,_ so I was aware of that, but I still
wanted to use `React` since I really enjoy working with that framework and it's the
one I'm the most comfortable with. I had quite a difficult time deciding on the specifics
of how I wanted it to look, but eventually decided to take some inspiration out of
my own [personal portfolio](https://portfolio-saulprl.vercel.app). This time, though,
I wanted to learn new stuff, so I decided to integrate [MDX](https://mdxjs.com).
That way, I can just write my blog entries in `markdown` instead of HTML, while also
adding some of my custom components with `React`.

<br />
Being honest, it was a bit more complicated than I expected, but I achieved what
I wanted, so it was worth exploring. Of course, I plan on improving the design and
adding more content to it so my blog entries don't just feel like a bunch of text,
but that'll come with time.
