# Spark Week 4

<br />
During my fourth week as a Spark, we were assigned our **first full project** and were given a couple of talks regarding the Operations Team's purpose and the _art of receiving and giving feedback_. To start this essay off, I will first be focusing on the meetings.

<br />
## Meetings

<br />
### Operations Team

The Operations Team talk was given to us by **Sasha Valdes**, who introduced us to the whole team and their activities as a whole and how they interact with the different areas across Encora. Some of the talks main takeaway points were:

<br />
- The Operations Team is a **service area** for the organization, and is oriented to business, focused on teams, and centered in people.
- It coordinates and evaluates clients, teams, and people operations.
- It aims to enhance teams and people performance, skills, and best practices in collaboration with other service teams.
- It looks to maintain and grow the company's revenue entrusting the right software engineer with the right job position.

<br />
### The Art of feedback

Later on the week, we attended a meeting on _The Art of Feedback_ by **Anabel Montiel**. We started off by looking at different definitions of growth: **vertical** and **integral**; the former being one-directional and individualistic, while the latter is multi-directional, balanced, and focused on having more impact. Integral growth can also be seen as the meaning of **ubuntu**: _"I'm at my best when you're at your best."_
<br />
Something that really stood out to me was representing feedback as a growth spiral, meaning that it's an iterative process in which you do something, you receive feedback, and therefore improve both your work and yourself. There were also some key points that specifically caught my attention, like not delaying giving or asking for feedback, being comfortable with uncomfortability, and focusing on content. Delaying (and more specifically, avoiding) is something that I usually struggle with ever since childhood but I've been actively working on it for the last couple of years. The latter two come hand-in-hand with delaying and avoiding, so I'm also getting better at that.
<br />
We had this meeting at the perfect moment because this week we were also given feedback about our previous assignments, and it helped me to not avoid it as much and focus on the content while reflecting on how to improve my work.
<br />
## Breakable Toy
<br />
As previously mentioned, we were assigned our **first full project**: a ToDo List app with both front-end and back-end implementations using `React` and `Java`, respectively. For this project, I decided to focus on the back-end first because it's been years since I worked with Java and I had no experience with `Spring Boot`. For this whole week, I managed to build about 85% of its features which involved fetching, updating, deleting, completing, and undoing ToDos, with only the filtering and pagination features left to implement. Overall, it's been fun to be able to start exploring a new technology and learning from the ground-up.
<br />
During the Spark Program Week 5, I'll be looking into finishing up the back-end and starting the front-end project, as well as researching testing libraries.
