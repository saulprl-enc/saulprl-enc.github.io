# Permutations

<br />
## Overview

<br />
_Permutations_ consists of generating all of the possible permutations (modifying
the order of the elements without affecting its structure) for an array of numbers.
In this case, we receive an array of numbers and should output a list of number arrays,
where every array is a permutation.

<br />
## Context

<br />
In order to solve this problem, you should have a good understanding of [permutations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permutation),
[array iteration](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_array_iteration.asp), and [recursion](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/recursion-in-javascript/).

<br />
## Solution

<br />
For this solution, I decided to implement a recursive function since I had worked
on something similar regarding combinations. In this case, though, I needed to generate
permutations. Like every recursive function, we must start with a base case so we
don't end up blowing up our computer. Since we will be internally modifying the array,
our base case will be to return an array with a single value when the array is of
length 1. Afterwards, we will loop through the array to extract the first number
of the array and then permute the remaining elements. After recursion is done, we
add all of the permutations obtained and store them in another array.

<br />
## Alternative solutions

<br />
Since I had previously worked on a similar function for combinations, I went directly
with the aforementioned approach, recursion. However, if it's possible with recursion,
it's also possible with loops.
